A defect was found during testing: While receiving customer data from a server the system crashed. The defect was fixed by correcting the code that checked the network availability during data transfer. The existing test cases covered 100% of all statements of the corresponding module. To verify the fix and to ensure more extensive coverage, some new tests were designed and added to the test suite and executed. So:What types of testing are described above? Functional testing,Structural testing,Re-testing, Performance testing 
A and B, but not C and D 
A and C, but not B and D 
A, B, and C, but not D 
B, C, and D, but not A

A.-is true. Receiving customer data is typical functional testing. B.-is true. In the problem description it was stated, "The existing test cases covered 100% of all statements of the corresponding module"; statement testing is structural testing. C.-is true. In the problem description it was stated, "To verify the fix and to ensure more extensive coverage, some new tests were designed and added to the test suite and executed", so this is a retest. D.-is false. In the problem description there is no information about performance testing.

Answer: A
Sentence A is CORRECT - Use cases describe how users interact with the completed system, therefore are best fitted for defining system-level tests. Additionally, "Use cases are very useful for designing acceptance tests with customer/user participation." (Section 4.3.5) ; Sentence B is WRONG - Use cases can be executed manually, not just automatically. ; Sentence C is WRONG - at the component level we derive test cases to increase code coverage. These are derived mostly by looking at the code, not by definition of a use case which will eventually exercise a certain piece of the code. ; Sentence D is CORRECT - "[use cases] also help uncover integration defects caused by the interaction and interference of different components" (Section 4.3.5)
